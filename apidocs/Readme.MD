# **Add API Docs (Open API Specifications) on the Gloo Portal**
## To add an open api specification on to Gloo Portal, simply add the open api specification yaml into the folder named "open-api-specifications"
## Make sure the file is named as "filename.yaml" where filename should have only alphabets (in lower case), numbers. You can use a '-' to seperate words in the name. Below is a valid file name for an open api specification:

```airtel-iq-messaging-api-v1-1.yaml```

#### That's it.... You are done. For creating products, go to ../apiproducts folder.
